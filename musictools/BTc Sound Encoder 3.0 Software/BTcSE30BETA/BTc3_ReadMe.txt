This software sonverts wave .WAV files to a 1bit sound
format that can be played on very cheap simple hardware
like a PIC or AVR microcontroller.

The software is fully functional and released under
Hippyware license; use it for free if you like, or pay
the author $10 if you like.

It should be as reliable as any previous versions of BTc
Sound Encoder, I have called it "Beta" as release of v3.0
co-incides with the TalkBot Project at www.TalkBotBrain.com
and I am currently awaiting feedback from Beta testers
in regards to adding new features and/or changing the
existing features.

Please email me with any feedback on this software;
